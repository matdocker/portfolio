        <p>
          I have been studying web development for about 2 years part-time &
          self taught. I developed a fascination with coding about 6 years ago
          but it has only been in the last few years I really felt I was able to
          make a career from coding.

          The building of tension followed by its satisfying release that
          problem solving brings, coupled with engineering solutions to everyday
          problems that potentially add value to the lives of others are the
          prime motivators of my endeavors.{" "}

          With emerging technologies like the Internet of Things, AI, Machine
          Learning and Deep Learning makes me very excited to think about what I
          might possibly be working on in years to come. The possibilities are
          endless really.{" "}

          In the world of web development I have a keen interest in learning the
          MERN stack. The idea of a completely javascript technology stack means
          less time learning a new language and more time learning new and
          better ways to apply the tools.
